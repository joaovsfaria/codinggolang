# First day of coding

Good night everyone, my name is João and let's start the challenge.

I’m a beginner, so if you disagree with anything that you disagree feel free to chat with me, probably we will get some knowledge together!

Why am I doing this? Because I’m trying to become a developer and a better professional, and in my point of view, a professional needs to contribute with the community, 
I know that most of us want to become a developer to stay alone in a room without talking to anyone, but that is not how it works. 
As a developer we hardly ever will build something all by yourself, most of the time we will work in teams, it can be difficult but that’s part of the work.

# Second day of coding

## The go programming language

So let’s talk about what really matter, the language I choose to start is Go or Golang.
So why golang?
Go is a language made by google that focus on performance and a simple syntax.

Here the link with the roadmap that I will follow.

[Learn to become a Go developer](https://roadmap.sh/golang)

As you can see in the roadmap it is not that easy, we have a lot of work to do, there are some topics that I don’t have any idea what they are, 
but I will try to understand them and explain here the easiest way that I can.
I will make my scripts and share them on GitHub.
