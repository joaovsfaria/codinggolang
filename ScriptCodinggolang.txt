# First day of coding

Good night everyone, my name is João and let's start the challenge.

I’m a beginner, so if you disagree with anything that you disagree feel free to chat with me, probably we will get some knowledge together!

Why am I doing this? Because I’m trying to become a developer and a better professional, and in my point of view, a professional needs to contribute with the community, 
I know that most of us want to become a developer to stay alone in a room without talking to anyone, but that is not how it works. 
As a developer we hardly ever will build something all by yourself, most of the time we will work in teams, it can be difficult but that’s part of the work.

# Second day of coding

## The go programming language

So let’s talk about what really matter, the language I choose to start is Go or Golang.
So why golang?
Go is a language made by google that focus on performance and a simple syntax.

Here the link with the roadmap that I will follow.

[Learn to become a Go developer](https://roadmap.sh/golang)

As you can see in the roadmap it is not that easy, we have a lot of work to do, there are some topics that I don’t have any idea what they are, 
but I will try to understand them and explain here the easiest way that I can.
I will make my scripts and share them on GitHub.

# Third day of coding

### Hello world!

So today I’m going to make my first functional program in Golang, with this few lines of code we can see a lot about how does this language works.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

You can run simple programs like this on Go Playground, where you don’t need to install anything to use it:

[Go Playground - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/play/)

What does it means all those words that I wrote?

- package

A golang program is built based on packages. The package “main” tells the compiler  that the package should compile as an executable program.

- import

There are packages already builds that we can use to make our daily work easy. We can import them in our code and use it’s functions. Package “fmt” is one of the most basic important package that we will use everyday. This package will allow us to “print” to the screen and “scan” from the user.

- func main

Func means function, we will see a lot of it in this challenge, but for now we need to know that our program will start with the this func and will finish with it too.

- fmt.Println()

In order to use other packages function we need to call them.

How do I  use a func from other packages?

First we need to call the package, this time is the fmt.

Second we cal the function by its name, in this case we will call Println()

Notice that the func should start with a capital letter.

We separate the name of the package and the name of the func by a dot.
